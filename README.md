# React/TS Refactor Exercise


**Goal:**

You’ve joined a project where the Reservations drawer & list are mostly working but were implemented quickly by a junior dev.

Your task:

- Review the existing code for correctness, performance, accessibility, UX, and maintainability issues.
- Identify potential bugs and gotchas that might appear in real-world use (e.g., race conditions, stale state, edge cases).
- Propose or implement key refactors to improve reliability, readability, and user experience.

You should focus on:

- Data flow & state management (API calls, form state, derived values).
- Async safety (open/close race conditions, stale data, error handling).
- Performance (re-renders, sorting, filtering, pagination).
- Accessibility & UX (keyboard navigation, focus trapping, form validation, loading states).
- Code clarity & maintainability (duplicated logic, derived state, component boundaries).

Don’t rewrite everything from scratch—treat this like a real PR review where your goal is to make surgical, high-impact changes and explain your reasoning.

**Deliverables:**
- A list of issues you’d raise in code review.
- Suggested refactors or a PR with improvements.
- (Optional) Any tests or dev tooling you think would help prevent regressions.


**Timebox:** 60 mins live (screen share).
